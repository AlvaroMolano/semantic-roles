# Semantic Roles

This repository contains the Jupyter notebooks and datasets for my ongoing research on semantic roles in Biblical Hebrew. The project is part of a PhD trajectory with [Vrije Universiteit](https://www.vu.nl), Amsterdam.

The research draws on various linguistic theories, including Role and Reference Grammar and Construction Grammar. The analysis of Biblical verbs and their arguments is carried out on the richly annotated database, the ETCBC-database (formerly known as the WIVU database), that is freely available for download. The Python package [Text-Fabric](https://github.com/annotation/text-fabric) is used for querying and extrating the linguistic data. 

## New TF-features
The research has so far resulted in two new Text-fabric features that can easily be downloaded in used in other projects (see instructions [here](https://annotation.github.io/text-fabric/Api/App/#incantation):

  * *dyna*: An annotation of the dynamicity of the verb (active or stative)
  * *caus*: An annotation of the causativity of the verb (causative or not)
